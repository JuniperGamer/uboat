# Features
Uboat is a JavaScript library that provides a simple and fun way to encrypt and decrypt text using a modified version of the Morse code. It replaces the dots and dashes of Morse code with a unique set of numbers that represent each letter of the alphabet, making it a more secure way to encrypt text.

Here is a list of features currently available in Uboat:

- Encoding text into Uboat code using toUboat() function
- Decoding Uboat code back into plain text using fromUboat() function
- A help command that lists all available commands
- A clear command that clears the console
- A command to redirect the user to the Uboat GitHub repository
- Uboat is still in development, so more features may be added in the future.
