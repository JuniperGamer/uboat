### Legacy Versions

Legacy Versions are the versions of Uboat that I would not like to work on, nor do not need. A practical way of understanding this,
is that I would like to discard of these versions from the main branch without deleting them. Hence why Legacy Versions are available.
These Legacy Versions can be edited and used in anyway but will not be officially updated.
